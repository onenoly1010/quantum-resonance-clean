# 🔨 FORGE PRIMER: Quantum Pi Forge Covenant

## The Covenant in Three Sentences
1. **We build ethical infrastructure** that bridges Hugging Face AI with Pi Network's decentralized ecosystem.
2. **Every commit is a vow** recorded in the seal ledger, binding technical execution to communal resonance.
3. **The forge is alive** through continuous ritual cadence: ingest, audit, broadcast, resonate.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 🔮 The Architect
- Designs system architecture and integration patterns
- Ensures alignment with Pi Network SDK and Hugging Face APIs
- Maintains technical vision and roadmap

### ⚔️ The Guardian
- Monitors security and wallet integrity
- Manages access control and authentication
- Safeguards private keys and sensitive credentials

### 📡 The Broadcaster
- Manages telemetry and monitoring systems
- Broadcasts system health and performance metrics
- Coordinates webhook integrations

### 🌊 The Resonator
- Ensures community alignment and engagement
- Tracks mining boosts and Pi Network participation
- Maintains ritual calendar and cadence

## Initiation Protocol

### Phase 1: Environment Setup
1. Clone the quantum-resonance-clean repository
2. Configure `.env` file with required credentials (see `.env.example`)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Verify Pi Network SDK connectivity

### Phase 2: Forge Activation
1. Initialize wallet connection (testnet first)
2. Verify Hugging Face API access
3. Run initial health checks
4. Confirm telemetry streams are active

### Phase 3: Ritual Engagement
1. Subscribe to ritual calendar notifications
2. Join community channels
3. Complete first commit ceremony
4. Record vow in seal ledger

## Core Rituals

### Daily Rituals
- **Morning Resonance**: System health check and log review
- **Evening Broadcast**: Telemetry summary and metrics update

### Weekly Rituals
- **Sunday Audit**: Security review and dependency updates
- **Wednesday Integration**: Feature deployment and testing

### Monthly Rituals
- **Full Moon Assembly**: Community sync and roadmap review
- **New Moon Reflection**: Technical debt assessment and cleanup

## Sacred Principles

1. **Transparency**: All code is open, all commits are public
2. **Security**: Private keys never touch the repository
3. **Community**: Individual contribution serves collective resonance
4. **Sustainability**: Mining boosts support long-term viability
5. **Ethics**: AI alignment with human flourishing

## Integration Points

### Pi Network
- Payment flows through Pi SDK
- User authentication via Pi Auth
- Mining boost optimization

### Hugging Face
- Model inference endpoints
- Dataset management
- Space deployment

### Telemetry Hub
- Real-time metrics streaming
- Alert threshold monitoring
- Webhook event distribution

## Seal Ledger

Every commit creates an entry in our seal ledger:
- **Timestamp**: When the vow was made
- **Author**: Who made the vow
- **Hash**: The cryptographic seal
- **Message**: The commitment statement
